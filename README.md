Simple Solidity Contract:

Working:
The contract takes secret message (_srtmsg) and password (_passwd) as the inputs and stores it in the blockchain. The deployer is made the owner and can make changes to the message through a function (srtmsg_change) by typing the correct password (modifier is used to make it Owner only). An event is created to record the changes in the message. The contents of the message (srtmsg) can be viewed as it is public. In case of plain transactions, receive and fallback are added.

Challenges Faced:
I didn't have prior knowledge on the technical part of blockchain so I had to start from scratch. In this short time, I could only pull off to learn the basics of solidity and create a simple contract (Therefore, I won't be able to post the scripts, hardhat and sepolia testrun).But I didn't face any major challenge when writing the code, it was kinda hectic, but the result was all worth.
