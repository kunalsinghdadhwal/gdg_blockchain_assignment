## ðŸ“Œ Contract Overview

- **Contract Name:** `Lock` (PersonalLocker variant)
- **Features:**
  - Stores an initial message and password on deployment.
  - Only owner can update the message, and only with the correct password.
  - Emits an event on updates with old and new messages.
  - Provides public view to read message.
  - `showPsw()` restricted to owner.
  - Includes `receive()` and `fallback()` functions.
  - Uses OpenZeppelin `Ownable` for owner access.

## ðŸ“Œ How it Works (Explanation)

- On deployment, contract stores **initial message** (my full name) and a **secret password**.
- Only the deployer (owner) can update the message, but update requires the **correct password**.
- Update emits an event logging old and new messages (not the password).
- Any user can read the message using `readMsg()`.
- I used `keccak256` encoding to compare passwords, since Solidity does not support direct string comparison.
- The contract was tested locally with Hardhat and deployed successfully on Sepolia testnet.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Challenges Faced

- I usually work with **Foundry (forge)** for scripting, testing, and deployment.
- Writing scripts in **JavaScript for Hardhat** was a bit challenging since it was a new workflow for me.
- Understanding how to use `ethers` with Hardhat to attach, deploy, and interact took some time.
- Everything else including writing the contract logic and using OpenZeppelin was straightforward.
