# Sample Hardhat Project
# I'm working on fork and other blockchain basics stuff for gdg interviews. 
# I'm making a a simple Solidity smart contract called "PersonalLocker" that lets the deployer (owner) store a secret message and a password. The contract should include a constructor, an owner-only update guarded by a password, an event for updates, and a public view to read the messages.
